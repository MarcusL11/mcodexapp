## Intro
Django, a robust web framework, empowers developers to build dynamic and feature-rich web applications. While its built-in features streamline development, there are times when developers need to inject custom data or logic into every Django template across their project. This is where Django context processors come into play. In this blog post, we'll explore the concept of context processors and demonstrate how to create and integrate them into your Django project. Context processors allow you to define custom variables or functions that will be available in every template, providing a convenient way to share dynamic data or perform specific actions across your application.

## Understanding Context Processors
Django context processors act as bridges between your Python code and templates. They allow you to preprocess data before it reaches the templates, enabling you to inject custom information seamlessly. This can be incredibly useful for scenarios where you want to display dynamic content, such as user-specific data, in multiple templates without duplicating code.


## 1. Create a Django App
Start by creating a new Django app for your context processor. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp custom_context
```

## Step 1: Create a Django App
```bash
python manage.py startapp custom_context
```

## Step 2: Create a Context Processor
Create a file named `context_processors.py` inside your app directory (`custom_context` in this case).

```python
# custom_context/context_processors.py

def custom_variable(request):
    # Define your custom variable logic here
    custom_value = "Hello from Context Processor!"
    
    return {'custom_variable': custom_value}
```

## Step 3: Register Context Processor
In your Django app, create a `context_processors` module and register your custom context processor.

```python
# custom_context/__init__.py

# Ensure this file is present, it can be empty.
```

```python
# custom_context/apps.py

from django.apps import AppConfig

class CustomContextConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'custom_context'
```

```python
# YourProject/settings.py

# Add the context processor to the TEMPLATES option in your project's settings.

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / "templates"],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                # Other context processors...
                'custom_context.context_processors.custom_variable',  # Add this line
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

## Step 4: Use the Custom Variable in Templates
In your templates, you can now use the `custom_variable` in Django Template Language.

```html
<!-- Your template file -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Custom Context Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{ custom_variable }}</h1>
    <!-- Other HTML content... -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 5: Run Your Django App
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser, and you should see your custom variable rendered in the template.

That's it! You've successfully created a Django Template Language variable tag using a context processor. Feel free to customize the context processor logic according to your requirements.
